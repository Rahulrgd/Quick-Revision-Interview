### Differences between `ApplicationContext` and `BeanFactory` in Spring

In the Spring Framework, both `ApplicationContext` and `BeanFactory` are interfaces that represent the Spring IoC container. They are responsible for managing beans, but there are some key differences in their functionality and usage. 

#### Overview of `BeanFactory`

- **Purpose**: `BeanFactory` is the root interface for accessing Spring beans. It is the simplest container, offering basic functionality for managing beans and dependency injection.
- **Lightweight**: It is generally more lightweight and provides only the essential features needed to manage beans, making it ideal for simple applications or low-memory environments.
- **Lazy Loading**: By default, `BeanFactory` initializes beans lazily, meaning it creates beans only when they are requested.

#### Overview of `ApplicationContext`

- **Purpose**: `ApplicationContext` is a more advanced container that builds on `BeanFactory` to provide additional functionality, such as event propagation, declarative mechanisms, and application-level services.
- **Eager Loading**: By default, `ApplicationContext` eagerly initializes all singleton beans during context startup, ensuring that all dependencies are resolved before the application is accessed.
- **Preferred for Modern Applications**: `ApplicationContext` is generally recommended for most Spring applications due to its richer feature set.

### Key Differences Between `BeanFactory` and `ApplicationContext`

| Feature                          | `BeanFactory`                               | `ApplicationContext`                          |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Default Bean Initialization**  | Lazy initialization (only when requested).  | Eager initialization (at startup for singletons). |
| **Event Handling**               | Not supported.                              | Supports event handling and publishing.       |
| **Internationalization**         | Not supported.                              | Supports internationalization with message resources. |
| **Application Events**           | Not available.                              | Allows event publishing and listening with `ApplicationEvent` and `ApplicationListener`. |
| **Autowiring**                   | Limited autowiring capabilities.            | Provides advanced autowiring and dependency injection support. |
| **Annotation Support**           | Limited.                                    | Full support for annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, and others. |
| **Ideal Use Cases**              | Lightweight applications, low-resource environments. | Recommended for most applications, especially large, enterprise-level applications. |

### Example Comparison

#### Using `BeanFactory`
```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.XmlBeanFactory;
import org.springframework.core.io.ClassPathResource;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize BeanFactory
        BeanFactory factory = new XmlBeanFactory(new ClassPathResource("beans.xml"));
        
        // Get beans lazily
        UserService userService = (UserService) factory.getBean("userService");
        userService.createUser();
    }
}
```

#### Using `ApplicationContext`
```java
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize ApplicationContext
        ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
        
        // Get beans eagerly (singleton)
        UserService userService = context.getBean(UserService.class);
        userService.createUser();
    }
}
```

### When to Use Each

- **Use `BeanFactory`** if memory efficiency is critical and advanced features like event handling or internationalization are not required.
- **Use `ApplicationContext`** for most applications, as it provides additional services and is generally the recommended approach in modern Spring applications.

### Summary

While `BeanFactory` provides basic functionality and is more memory-efficient, `ApplicationContext` is feature-rich and better suited for full-featured applications. Because of its comprehensive services, `ApplicationContext` is typically preferred for most applications, offering benefits like event handling, internationalization, and automatic bean initialization.
