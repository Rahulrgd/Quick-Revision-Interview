I'll break down the interview preparation topics for a 2-year Java backend developer into four parts, focusing on the key areas relevant to your experience level and expertise. Here’s the outline:

### Part 1: Core Java and OOP Concepts
1. **Java Fundamentals**:
   - Java syntax, memory management, JVM, JRE, JDK, and differences between them.
   - Data types, operators, exception handling, and basic I/O operations.
2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - Key principles: inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction.
   - Practical applications of OOP in real-world projects, design of classes, and object relationships.
3. **Collections Framework**:
   - Core interfaces: List, Set, Queue, Map, and their implementations (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, HashSet).
   - Best use cases for each and understanding time complexities of key operations.
4. **Multithreading and Concurrency**:
   - Thread lifecycle, Runnable and Callable interfaces, synchronization, locks.
   - Key classes (e.g., ExecutorService, Future, Semaphore) and handling concurrency issues.

After this, I'll share Part 2 with a focus on Spring and Backend Development. Let me know if you’d like to proceed this way or if there are any specific areas you want prioritized.
