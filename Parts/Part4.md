### Part 4: Data Management, DevOps Basics, and Soft Skills

1. **Data Management**:
   - **SQL and Database Design**: Deepen knowledge of SQL queries, joins, indexing, and performance optimization.
   - **NoSQL Databases**: Familiarity with NoSQL concepts (e.g., MongoDB, Redis) and their applications in microservices.
   - **Caching**: Caching strategies for improving performance, including Redis and in-memory caches. Caching with Spring (e.g., `@Cacheable`).
   - **Transaction Management**: Understanding ACID properties, distributed transactions, and handling transactions in microservices.
2. **DevOps Basics**:
   - **Version Control with Git**: Advanced Git operations, branching strategies (e.g., Git Flow), and collaboration workflows.
   - **CI/CD Pipelines**: Setting up CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and deployment with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions.
   - **Docker and Containerization**: Basics of Docker, creating Dockerfiles, and managing containers. Understanding container orchestration concepts (e.g., Kubernetes).
   - **Cloud Services**: Fundamentals of cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP), particularly for deployment, storage, and scalability.
3. **Soft Skills**:
   - **Team Collaboration**: Communicating effectively in team environments, participating in code reviews, and providing constructive feedback.
   - **Problem-Solving**: Approaching technical challenges logically, discussing solutions, and explaining your thought process during interviews.
   - **Project Experience**: Presenting your work on projects like Ledger Flux, explaining design choices, challenges, and impact.

Preparing these areas thoroughly will showcase your technical expertise, experience with microservices, and ability to contribute to a team effectively.
