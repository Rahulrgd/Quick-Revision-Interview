### Part 3: Microservices and Distributed Systems
1. **Microservices Architecture**:
   - Core principles of microservices architecture: modularization, loose coupling, and scalability.
   - Differences between monolithic and microservices architectures, and the advantages and challenges of each.
2. **API Gateway and Service Discovery**:
   - Using API gateways (e.g., Zuul or Spring Cloud Gateway) for routing, load balancing, and security.
   - Understanding service discovery (e.g., Eureka, Consul) for managing and locating services in microservice-based systems.
3. **Inter-Service Communication**:
   - Synchronous (e.g., REST, gRPC) vs. asynchronous (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) communication.
   - Best practices for API design in microservices, and handling data consistency across services.
4. **Messaging with Kafka**:
   - Kafka fundamentals: topics, partitions, producers, and consumers.
   - Understanding Kafka's role in event-driven architecture, stream processing basics, and setting up reliable messaging.
5. **Resilience and Fault Tolerance**:
   - Implementing resilience with libraries like Resilience4j for circuit breakers, retries, and timeouts.
   - Techniques to handle failures gracefully in distributed environments and ensure application robustness.
6. **Observability**:
   - Logging, monitoring, and tracing with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Zipkin.
   - Tracking performance metrics, managing alerts, and understanding the importance of distributed tracing in microservices.

The final part, Part 4, will cover Data Management, DevOps Basics, and Soft Skills, as these areas are essential to backend roles with a microservices focus. Let me know if you'd like further details on any of these microservices topics.
