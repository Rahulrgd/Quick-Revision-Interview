In **Spring Data JPA**, named queries allow you to define queries at the entity level, making them reusable across different parts of your application. Named queries can be defined using the `@NamedQuery` and `@NamedNativeQuery` annotations, which help improve readability and maintainability, especially for complex queries.

### 1. **Named Queries with `@NamedQuery`**

- **Definition**: `@NamedQuery` is used to define a JPQL query statically in the entity class. The query can then be referenced by its name throughout the application.

- **Usage**: Named queries are particularly useful for queries that are frequently used and need to be reused without rewriting the query each time.

**Example: Defining a Named Query**

```java
@Entity
@NamedQuery(
    name = "User.findByLastName",
    query = "SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.lastName = :lastName"
)
public class User {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

**Using the Named Query**

```java
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    @Query(name = "User.findByLastName")
    List<User> findByLastName(@Param("lastName") String lastName);
}
```

### 2. **Named Native Queries with `@NamedNativeQuery`**

- **Definition**: `@NamedNativeQuery` is used to define a native SQL query. Similar to named queries, it allows you to reference the query by name.

- **Usage**: Use named native queries when you need to execute SQL queries that may include database-specific syntax or optimizations not supported by JPQL.

**Example: Defining a Named Native Query**

```java
@Entity
@NamedNativeQuery(
    name = "User.findActiveUsers",
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true",
    resultClass = User.class
)
public class User {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private boolean active;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

**Using the Named Native Query**

```java
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    @Query(name = "User.findActiveUsers")
    List<User> findActiveUsers();
}
```

### 3. **When to Use Named Queries**

- **Reusability**: Named queries are ideal for queries that need to be reused in multiple places throughout your application, promoting DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
  
- **Readability**: Named queries enhance readability by allowing you to use descriptive names rather than complex JPQL or SQL strings directly in repository methods.

- **Performance**: Named queries can potentially improve performance by allowing the persistence provider to cache the query plan, which may reduce the overhead of parsing the query each time itâ€™s executed.

- **Static Definition**: They enable you to define queries statically, making it easier to manage and update queries without changing multiple locations in your codebase.

### Summary

- Use `@NamedQuery` for defining reusable JPQL queries within your entity classes, improving maintainability and readability.
- Use `@NamedNativeQuery` for defining reusable native SQL queries.
- Named queries enhance reusability, readability, and potential performance benefits in your application.
