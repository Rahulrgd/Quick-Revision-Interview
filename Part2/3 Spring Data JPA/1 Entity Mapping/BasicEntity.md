Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of the basics of entities, primary keys, and composite keys in **Spring Data JPA**:

### 1. **Entity Basics**
   - In JPA, an entity is a lightweight, persistent domain object that represents a table in a relational database.
   - To define an entity, annotate a class with `@Entity`. You can use `@Table` to specify the database table name if it differs from the class name.

   ```java
   @Entity
   @Table(name = "users")
   public class User {
       @Id
       @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
       private Long id;
       
       private String name;
       private String email;

       // Getters and setters
   }
   ```

### 2. **Primary Key**
   - The `@Id` annotation is used to denote the primary key of an entity.
   - You can use `@GeneratedValue` to auto-generate values for primary keys, with strategies like `IDENTITY`, `SEQUENCE`, or `AUTO`.

   ```java
   @Entity
   public class Product {
       @Id
       @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)
       private Long productId;
       
       private String productName;

       // Getters and setters
   }
   ```

### 3. **Composite Key**
   - A composite key consists of multiple fields acting as the primary key. This is achieved by creating an `@Embeddable` class containing the key fields, then embedding it with `@EmbeddedId`.

   ```java
   @Embeddable
   public class OrderId implements Serializable {
       private Long orderId;
       private Long productId;

       // Equals and hashCode methods
   }

   @Entity
   public class Order {
       @EmbeddedId
       private OrderId orderId;

       private int quantity;

       // Getters and setters
   }
   ```

This structure allows defining simple primary keys as well as composite keys, supporting various relational database models effectively.
