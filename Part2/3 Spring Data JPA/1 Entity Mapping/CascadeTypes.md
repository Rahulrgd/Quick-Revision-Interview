In **Spring Data JPA**, cascade types control how persistence operations (like save, update, delete) propagate from one entity to its related entities. Here’s a breakdown of common cascade types and their impact, followed by an overview of `@Embeddable` and `@Embedded` for value-type objects.

### Cascade Types

1. **`CascadeType.ALL`**:
   - Propagates all operations (persist, merge, remove, refresh, detach) from the parent to the related entity.
   - Example: Deleting a `User` will also delete its `Profile` if `CascadeType.ALL` is used.

   ```java
   @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
   private Profile profile;
   ```

2. **`CascadeType.PERSIST`**:
   - Only propagates the `persist` operation, saving the related entity when the parent is saved.
   - Useful for relationships where the related entity should only be saved once.

   ```java
   @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST)
   private List<Address> addresses;
   ```

3. **`CascadeType.MERGE`**:
   - Propagates the `merge` operation, updating the related entity when the parent entity is updated.

4. **`CascadeType.REMOVE`**:
   - Propagates the `remove` operation, deleting the related entity when the parent is deleted.

5. **`CascadeType.REFRESH`**:
   - Propagates the `refresh` operation, reloading the state of the child entity whenever the parent is refreshed.

6. **`CascadeType.DETACH`**:
   - Propagates the `detach` operation, detaching the related entity when the parent entity is detached.

### `@Embeddable` and `@Embedded`

- `@Embeddable` is used to mark a class as a value-type object, which is an object whose fields are directly included in the parent entity’s table.
- `@Embedded` is used in the parent entity to include an `@Embeddable` object as part of its fields.

#### Example:

1. **Define the Embeddable Class**:

   ```java
   @Embeddable
   public class Address {
       private String street;
       private String city;
       private String zipcode;

       // Getters and setters
   }
   ```

2. **Use Embedded in the Entity**:

   ```java
   @Entity
   public class Customer {
       @Id
       @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
       private Long id;

       @Embedded
       private Address address;

       // Getters and setters
   }
   ```

Using `@Embeddable` and `@Embedded` enables reusability and encapsulation of value-type data within entities, making complex data structures more manageable. Cascade types, on the other hand, ensure efficient handling of persistence operations across entity relationships.
