### REST API for Kafka Connect: Managing Connectors

Kafka Connect provides a powerful REST API that allows you to manage connectors, monitor their status, and configure tasks programmatically. This enables seamless integration and automation of data pipelines. Below is an overview of how to use the Kafka Connect REST API for managing connectors.

#### 1. Overview of the Kafka Connect REST API

The Kafka Connect REST API exposes several endpoints that can be used to perform operations such as creating, deleting, and updating connectors, as well as retrieving information about their status. The base URL for the Kafka Connect REST API is typically:

```
http://<kafka-connect-host>:<port>
```

By default, the port is usually `8083`.

#### 2. Key REST API Endpoints

Here are some of the most important REST API endpoints for managing connectors:

- **List Connectors**
  - **Endpoint**: `GET /connectors`
  - **Description**: Retrieves a list of all registered connectors.
  
  **Example**:
  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8083/connectors
  ```

- **Get Connector Configuration**
  - **Endpoint**: `GET /connectors/{connector-name}/config`
  - **Description**: Retrieves the configuration for a specific connector.
  
  **Example**:
  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8083/connectors/my-connector/config
  ```

- **Create Connector**
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /connectors`
  - **Description**: Creates a new connector with the specified configuration.
  
  **Example**:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{
      "name": "my-connector",
      "config": {
        "connector.class": "org.apache.kafka.connect.jdbc.JdbcSourceConnector",
        "tasks.max": "1",
        "topics": "my_topic",
        "connection.url": "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb",
        "connection.user": "user",
        "connection.password": "password",
        "poll.interval.ms": "1000"
      }
    }' \
    http://localhost:8083/connectors
  ```

- **Delete Connector**
  - **Endpoint**: `DELETE /connectors/{connector-name}`
  - **Description**: Deletes a specific connector and all its tasks.
  
  **Example**:
  ```bash
  curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8083/connectors/my-connector
  ```

- **Get Connector Status**
  - **Endpoint**: `GET /connectors/{connector-name}/status`
  - **Description**: Retrieves the status of a specific connector and its tasks.
  
  **Example**:
  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8083/connectors/my-connector/status
  ```

- **Update Connector Configuration**
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /connectors/{connector-name}/config`
  - **Description**: Updates the configuration of an existing connector.
  
  **Example**:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{
      "tasks.max": "2"  // Update the max number of tasks
    }' \
    http://localhost:8083/connectors/my-connector/config
  ```

#### 3. Handling Connector Tasks

Each connector consists of one or more tasks that execute the actual data transfer. You can manage tasks using the REST API as well.

- **Get Task Status**
  - **Endpoint**: `GET /connectors/{connector-name}/tasks`
  - **Description**: Retrieves the list of tasks for a specific connector.

  **Example**:
  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8083/connectors/my-connector/tasks
  ```

- **Get Task Configuration**
  - **Endpoint**: `GET /connectors/{connector-name}/tasks/{task-id}/config`
  - **Description**: Retrieves the configuration for a specific task.

  **Example**:
  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8083/connectors/my-connector/tasks/0/config
  ```

#### 4. Error Handling

When using the REST API, itâ€™s important to handle errors gracefully. The API will return appropriate HTTP status codes, such as:

- **200 OK**: Successful request.
- **201 Created**: Connector created successfully.
- **404 Not Found**: Connector or task not found.
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid configuration or request parameters.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server-side error.

Make sure to check the response body for additional error details, which can help in troubleshooting.

### Summary

The Kafka Connect REST API provides a convenient way to manage connectors and monitor their status programmatically. By leveraging the various endpoints, you can automate tasks such as creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving information about connectors and their tasks. This functionality is essential for building robust data pipelines and integrating Kafka Connect into larger data processing workflows. Make sure to handle errors appropriately and refer to the official Kafka Connect documentation for detailed information on configuration options and best practices.
