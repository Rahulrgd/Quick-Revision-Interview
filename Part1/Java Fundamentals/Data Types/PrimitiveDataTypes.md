Here's a concise answer for your interview regarding primitive data types in Java:

---

In Java, primitive data types are the basic building blocks of data manipulation. They include:

1. **int**: A 32-bit signed integer, ranging from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
2. **double**: A 64-bit double-precision floating point, used for decimal values, with a range of approximately ±1.7E-308 to ±1.7E+308.
3. **char**: A 16-bit Unicode character, representing a single character, with a range of 0 to 65,535.
4. **byte**: An 8-bit signed integer, ranging from -128 to 127.
5. **short**: A 16-bit signed integer, ranging from -32,768 to 32,767.
6. **long**: A 64-bit signed integer, ranging from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
7. **float**: A 32-bit single-precision floating point, with a range of approximately ±3.4E-38 to ±3.4E+38.
8. **boolean**: Represents one of two values: true or false (size is not precisely defined).

These data types are essential for defining variables and performing operations in Java.
