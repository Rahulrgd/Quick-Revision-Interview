Java achieves platform independence primarily through **bytecode** and the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**. Here’s a breakdown of how this works:

1. **Compilation to Bytecode**:
   - When Java source code (in a `.java` file) is compiled by the Java Compiler (`javac`), it is converted into an intermediate, platform-independent format known as **bytecode** (stored in `.class` files).
   - Bytecode is not specific to any hardware or operating system, making it portable and independent of the platform on which it was compiled.
   - This bytecode can be transferred and run on any platform that has a compatible JVM.

2. **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**:
   - The JVM is a virtual machine that runs on various operating systems and devices, such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
   - Each platform has its own implementation of the JVM that knows how to translate Java bytecode into the machine-specific instructions needed for that platform.
   - During runtime, the JVM uses a **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler** to convert bytecode into native machine code specific to the host system, allowing the program to run as though it were written for that specific environment.

3. **Write Once, Run Anywhere**:
   - By using bytecode and the JVM, Java enables developers to “write once, run anywhere.” This means that Java programs can be written on one platform, compiled into bytecode, and then executed on any other platform with a compatible JVM.
   - The JVM handles all platform-specific details, like memory management and system calls, so developers do not need to worry about rewriting code for different operating systems.

**In summary**: Java achieves platform independence through the use of bytecode, which is platform-neutral, and the JVM, which is platform-specific. The JVM interprets and runs the bytecode on any compatible device, allowing Java applications to be executed on various systems without modification.
