Here are key Kafka Streams topics to focus on:

1. **Kafka Streams Basics**: Understand its purpose, how it enables stream processing on top of Kafka, and how it differs from other processing frameworks like Spark Streaming.

2. **Core Concepts**:
   - **Stream**: Unbounded sequence of records.
   - **Tables**: Materialized view of streams, allowing stateful processing.
   - **Store**: Persistent storage for state, e.g., RocksDB.

3. **Stream Processing APIs**:
   - **DSL (Domain-Specific Language)**: Simple operations like map, filter, join, etc.
   - **Processor API**: Low-level API for more complex transformations.

4. **Stateful and Stateless Operations**:
   - Stateless: Operations like filter, map that donâ€™t require state.
   - Stateful: Operations like aggregate, count, reduce that use state stores.

5. **Windowing**: Mechanism to define time intervals for operations like aggregations and joins. Types include tumbling, sliding, and session windows.

6. **Exactly Once Semantics (EOS)**: Support for exactly-once processing in Kafka Streams using idempotence and transaction support.

7. **Joins in Kafka Streams**:
   - Stream-stream joins (within a window).
   - Stream-table joins (join a stream with a table for enriched data).
   - Table-table joins.

8. **Fault Tolerance and Scaling**:
   - How Kafka Streams handles stateful processing using changelogs and standby replicas.
   - Partitioning and parallelism for scalability.

9. **KStream vs. KTable**:
   - KStream for unbounded data streams.
   - KTable for changelog streams (latest value of a key).

10. **Topology and Processing Graph**: The structure of transformations and nodes defining the data flow within Kafka Streams.

11. **Error Handling**: Handling exceptions in stream processing, such as deserialization errors or data corruption.

12. **Kafka Streams vs. Kafka Consumer API**: Differences in handling processing and state management, and why Kafka Streams is preferred for complex stream processing.

13. **Testing Kafka Streams**: Overview of testing strategies, such as using TopologyTestDriver for unit tests.

14. **Deployment Considerations**:
    - **Containerization**: Running Kafka Streams applications in Docker.
    - **Resource Allocation**: Optimal configuration for resource usage and scalability.

15. **Metrics and Monitoring**: Key metrics to monitor Kafka Streams applications, including lag, throughput, and error rates.
