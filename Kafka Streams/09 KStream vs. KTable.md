In Kafka Streams, **KStream** and **KTable** represent two different abstractions for handling data streams, each suited for specific types of processing.

### 1. **KStream**
   - **Definition**: A `KStream` is an unbounded stream of records, where each record is considered an independent event.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for processing continuous, unbounded data where each event is meaningful, like clickstream data, sensor readings, or logs.
   - **Operations**: Supports transformations like `map`, `filter`, `join`, and windowed operations like aggregations over a period.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Each record is processed as it arrives.
     - No concept of state or snapshot; every record is retained as-is, even if the same key reappears.
   
   **Example of a KStream**:
   ```java
   KStream<String, String> stream = builder.stream("input-topic");

   // Apply transformations, e.g., filter records with values starting with "A"
   KStream<String, String> filteredStream = stream.filter((key, value) -> value.startsWith("A"));
   filteredStream.to("output-topic");
   ```

### 2. **KTable**
   - **Definition**: A `KTable` is a changelog stream that holds the latest value for each key, effectively creating a snapshot or view of data.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for processing data that represents an evolving state or aggregate, like customer profiles, product inventories, or user preferences.
   - **Operations**: Supports `join`, `aggregate`, and `filter` operations, always reflecting the latest value for each key.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Each keyâ€™s value is updated when new records arrive with the same key.
     - Represents a **materialized view** of the data, with the latest values for each key, making it suitable for lookups or joins.

   **Example of a KTable**:
   ```java
   KTable<String, String> table = builder.table("input-table-topic");

   // Join the KTable with another stream to enrich data
   KStream<String, String> enrichedStream = someStream.leftJoin(
       table,
       (streamValue, tableValue) -> streamValue + " enriched with " + tableValue
   );
   enrichedStream.to("enriched-output-topic");
   ```

### Summary
- **KStream**: For unbounded data streams, treating each record as an independent event.
- **KTable**: For changelog streams, maintaining only the latest value for each key, representing a materialized view of state.
