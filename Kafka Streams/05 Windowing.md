In Kafka Streams, **windowing** allows you to group records based on time intervals for stateful operations like aggregation and joins. Windowing is essential for processing time-based data and handling events that arrive within specific time frames. Hereâ€™s an overview of the main types of windows in Kafka Streams:

### 1. **Tumbling Windows**
   - Non-overlapping, fixed-size intervals. Each record belongs to exactly one window.
   - Ideal for periodic reporting, where data is divided into distinct, continuous blocks.
   
   **Example**: A 10-minute tumbling window to count records.
   ```java
   KTable<Windowed<String>, Long> tumblingCounts = stream
       .groupByKey()
       .windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(Duration.ofMinutes(10)))  // Fixed 10-minute window
       .count();
   tumblingCounts.toStream().to("tumbling-counts-output");
   ```

### 2. **Sliding Windows**
   - Overlapping, fixed-size intervals that allow each record to appear in multiple windows, depending on a sliding interval.
   - Useful for continuous analysis with overlapping data, like detecting trends in overlapping periods.
   
   **Example**: A 5-minute sliding window with a 1-minute slide to average values.
   ```java
   KTable<Windowed<String>, Double> slidingAvg = stream
       .groupByKey()
       .windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(Duration.ofMinutes(5)).advanceBy(Duration.ofMinutes(1)))  // 5-minute window, sliding by 1 minute
       .aggregate(
           () -> 0.0,  // Initializer
           (key, value, aggregate) -> (aggregate + Double.parseDouble(value)) / 2,  // Aggregator
           Materialized.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.Double())
       );
   slidingAvg.toStream().to("sliding-avg-output");
   ```

### 3. **Session Windows**
   - Dynamic, event-driven intervals defined by an inactivity gap. If a new event does not arrive within the defined gap, the session closes.
   - Effective for user interactions or any data with irregular intervals, where sessions or bursts of activity need to be identified.
   
   **Example**: A session window with a 2-minute inactivity gap to sum values.
   ```java
   KTable<Windowed<String>, Long> sessionCounts = stream
       .groupByKey()
       .windowedBy(SessionWindows.with(Duration.ofMinutes(2)))  // Closes after 2 minutes of inactivity
       .count();
   sessionCounts.toStream().to("session-counts-output");
   ```

### Summary
- **Tumbling Windows**: Fixed, non-overlapping periods (e.g., hourly or daily reports).
- **Sliding Windows**: Overlapping periods for continuous analysis, ideal for trending data.
- **Session Windows**: Flexible, activity-based periods defined by inactivity gaps.
