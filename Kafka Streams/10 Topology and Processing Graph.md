In Kafka Streams, the **topology** refers to the structure of the stream processing application, defining how data flows through various transformations and the relationships between them. The topology is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where each node in the graph performs a specific operation on the data.

### Key Components of Topology

1. **Nodes**:
   - Each node represents a processing step or operation, such as filtering, mapping, joining, or aggregating data.
   - There are two main types of nodes:
     - **Source Nodes**: The entry points of the data stream, which read from Kafka topics.
     - **Processor Nodes**: Nodes that perform transformations on the incoming data streams, processing it according to defined logic.

2. **Edges**:
   - Edges represent the flow of data between nodes, indicating how data is passed from one processing step to another.
   - The flow is typically unidirectional, meaning data flows from source to processor nodes without looping back.

3. **Source Nodes**:
   - These nodes are defined using the `stream` or `table` methods, indicating the starting point of the data flow.
   - For example, a source node may read data from a specific Kafka topic.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   KStream<String, String> sourceStream = builder.stream("input-topic");  // Source node
   ```

4. **Processor Nodes**:
   - Nodes that perform transformations on the data, such as filtering, mapping, joining, or aggregating.
   - You can use the DSL (Domain-Specific Language) for high-level transformations or the Processor API for more complex processing logic.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   KStream<String, String> filteredStream = sourceStream.filter((key, value) -> value.contains("keyword"));  // Processor node
   ```

5. **Sink Nodes**:
   - These nodes output the processed data back to Kafka topics or other external systems.
   - Sink nodes are usually defined at the end of the topology.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   filteredStream.to("output-topic");  // Sink node
   ```

### Building a Topology

You can define the entire topology using the `StreamsBuilder`, which organizes all the nodes and their connections.

**Example of a Complete Topology**:
```java
StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();

// Source Node
KStream<String, String> sourceStream = builder.stream("input-topic");

// Processor Nodes
KStream<String, String> filteredStream = sourceStream.filter((key, value) -> value.contains("keyword"));
KStream<String, String> mappedStream = filteredStream.mapValues(value -> value.toUpperCase());

// Sink Node
mappedStream.to("output-topic");

// Build the topology
KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(builder.build(), properties);
streams.start();
```

### Summary
- The **topology** defines the structure of the data processing application in Kafka Streams.
- It consists of **nodes** (source, processor, sink) that perform operations on the data and **edges** that indicate data flow.
- The topology is built using the `StreamsBuilder`, which organizes the various transformations and processing steps.
